    "description": "Fork of dash-to-panel adding a applications menu on right-click. An icon taskbar for the Gnome Shell. This extension moves the dash into the gnome main panel so that the application launchers and system tray are combined into a single panel, similar to that found in KDE Plasma and Windows 7+. A separate dock is no longer needed for easy access to running and favorited applications.\n\nFor a more traditional experience, you may also want to use Tweak Tool to enable Windows > Titlebar Buttons > Minimize & Maximize.\n\nFor the best support, please report any issues on Github. Dash-to-panel is developed and maintained by @milottit.",
